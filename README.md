This is a repository of reverse-engineered games, from retro arcade, console and microcomputer platforms.

In each case the binaries were disassembled, analysed and annotated - in most cases - down to the instruction level (either self-documenting via labels, or commented). Subroutines and data elements are given meaningful labels and principal data structures are documented.

It should be possible to reassemble the code and recreate the original binary, or completely relocate the program. Some games include asm listings with enhancements and/or options to build for other targets. (If not included, asm files generally available on request).

Some of these RE's have been used as the basis for a transcode to another CPU in ASM, or C code (or in some cases, both).

Currently, the repository comprises:

## Arcade

- Asteroids
- Space Invaders (aka. invaders)
- Xevious

## Console

  (TBD)
  
## Computer

### TRS-80 (Model 1/3/4)
- Invasion Force (w/enhanced ASM)
- Tandy Invaders (w/enhanced ASM)

### ZXSpectrum
- Knight Lore
