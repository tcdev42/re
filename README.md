This is a repository of reverse-engineered games, from retro arcade, console and microcomputer platforms.

In each case the binaries were disassembled, analysed and annotated - in most cases - down to the instruction level. Subroutines and data elements are given meaningful labels and principal data structures are documented.

It should be possible to reassemble the code and recreate the original binary, or completely relocate the program (asm files available on request).

Some of these have been used as the basis for a transcode to another CPU in ASM, or C code (or in some cases, both).

Currently, the repository comprises:

## Arcade:

- Xevious

## Computer:

### ZXSpectrum

* Knight Lore
